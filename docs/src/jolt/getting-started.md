# Getting Started

Welcome to Jolt! This guide will help you quickly get started with this reactive state management library for Dart and Flutter.

## Installation

Install Jolt using the `pub add` command:

```bash
# Install the core package
dart pub add jolt
```

For Flutter projects, we recommend installing `jolt_flutter`:

```bash
# Recommended: Flutter Widget integration
flutter pub add jolt_flutter
```

If you're using Flutter Hooks, you can optionally install `jolt_hooks`:

```bash
# Optional: Hooks integration
flutter pub add jolt_hooks
```

If you prefer the Cubit-style state container pattern, you can install `jolt_surge`:

```bash
# Optional: Surge pattern (inspired by BLoC's Cubit)
flutter pub add jolt_surge
```
